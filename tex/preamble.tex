\begin{acknowledgments}
First and foremost, I'd like to thank and acknowledge my thesis advisor Joshua Jacobs. I've known Josh since I was an undergraduate and he was a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, over a decade ago. Through all that time, even well before I knew I'd be his student, Josh has been a source of knowledge and guidance. Josh has taught me how to be a successful scientist, and, moreover, Josh has given me a set of skills that I am confident will serve me well in the future. I'm grateful to call Josh my friend, and I'm looking forward to our continued collaborations over the years to come.

I am also indebted to Michael Kahana, who I've worked with for many years, and with whom I still collaborate. It was because of Mike that I first became interested in neuroscience, and it was through working in his lab that I first began to understand the excitement that comes from trying to unravel the mysteries of the human brain. I would also like to thank many current and former members of the Kahana lab, in particular those who have helped me with the arduous task of data collection, including Emily Rosenberg, Erin Beck, Ryan Baily Williams, Patrick Crutchley, Ashwin Ramayya, John Burke, Deb Levy, and Anastasia Lyalenko. In addition, I'm grateful for my current lab members, notably Tom Coffey and Sang Ah Lee, for their invaluable support and insights over the course of graduate career.

These acknowledgments would be incomplete without mentioning my clinical collaborators at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and Freiburg University Hospital in Germany. It is through their efforts that I am afforded the rare opportunity to collect human neural recordings. I'd also like to thank the patients themselves from which I've collected data, who selflessly volunteer to participate in our studies and who make this entire endeavor possible.

Lastly, I'd like to thank my wife Nicole Long for .............
