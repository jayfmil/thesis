\section{Summary}

In this dissertation, I recorded intracranial brain activity as patients traveled through carefully designed 3D virtual environments in order to investigate the neural signals related to spatial navigation and memory function. My work has shown that the neural mechanisms responsible for representing external space are also involved in the storage and retrieval of episodic memories, helping to reconcile how the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe can simultaneously be vital for both navigation and declarative memory abilities.









Using carefully designed 3D virtual environments, I
