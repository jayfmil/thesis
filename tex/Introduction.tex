\chapter{Introduction}



% What does the intro need to cover?
%
% Human memory. episodic. hippocampus.
% Rodent spatial navigation backround. Place cells. Theta.
%
%
% Stupid everyday example of memory in space. How do we do this? To understand, we need to bring together two fields that are often distinct.

% Memory for space.

As we move through our lives, we also move through the world. We go from room to room within our homes, we commute from our homes to our workplace, we travel throughout our neighborhoods and cities, and we take vacations to explore new countries. As we move, we learn our way around our environment. We create an internal map - an internal representation of external space - that allows us to get from place to place, and, \hl{importantly}, provides us with the means to keep track of where the events that we experience in our lives occur. Somehow, we have the ability to both navigate our world, and to form rich detailed memories as we move through it.

When we reimagine the past, be it what we had for breakfast today or a favorite childhood birthday party from decades prior, the location of the past event is one of the primary and salient features of the memory.

% - What is the thesis really about?
% - How the human brain supports spatial navigation
% - Integration of episodic memory and spatial navigation (what happened where?)
% - Is this about memory? Space? Physiology? What frames the whole thing?
% - How does the train task fit into this?
% - Can't be overly cognitive
%
% - If it's what happened where, then it more is about memory. I'm starting to think it should be about ``space''. How space is coded, how it integrates with the memory system.

\section{The neural representation of space}
\section{From rodents to humans}
\section{Overview}

In chapter 2, I take what (limited) knowledge of what we know about the human neural representation of space and show how it fits into models of memory function.

In chapter 3, I extend our knowledge of the human neural representation of space, which further links rodent and human literature and gives us insight into the precise roles of MTL regions. New cell type is a key advancement of the field.

In chapter 4, I more precisely compare core findings from rodent navigation with human data fom a optimized task. some similarities, but some differences with important theoretical implications.

- Chapter 2: spatial components of episodic memories. context reinstatement.
- Chapter 3: ec repeating spatial activations. non-specific vs hipp specific.
- Chapter 4: role of theta in movement compared to rodents. Also memory..
