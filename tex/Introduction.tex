\chapter{Introduction}



What does the intro need to cover?

Human memory. episodic. hippocampus.
Rodent spatial navigation backround. Place cells. Theta.



- Chapter 2: spatial components of episodic memories. context reinstatement.
- Chapter 3: ec repeating spatial activations. non-specific vs hipp specific.
- Chapter 4: role of theta in movement compared to rodents. Also memory..


- What is the thesis really about?
- How the human brain supports spatial navigation
- Integration of episodic memory and spatial navigation (what happened where?)
- Is this about memory? Space? Physiology? What frames the whole thing?
- How does the train task fit into this?
- Can't be overly cognitive

- If it's what happened where, then it more is about memory. I'm starting to think it should be about ``space''. How space is coded, how it integrates with the memory system.
