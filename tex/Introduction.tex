% Stupid everyday example of memory in space. How do we do this? To understand, we need to bring together two fields that are often distinct.

As we move through our lives, we also move through the world. We go from room to room within our homes, we commute from our homes to our workplace, we travel throughout our neighborhoods and cities, and we take vacations to explore new countries. As we move, we learn our way around our environment. We create an internal map - an internal representation of external space - that allows us to get from place to place, and, in addition, provides us with the means to keep track of where the events that we experience in our lives occur. We have the ability to both navigate our world, and to form rich detailed memories as we move through it. Somehow, our brains support these dual abilities, which are fundamental for our daily quality of life.

Decades of neuroscience research have attempted to uncover the neural mechanisms responsible for spatial navigation and memory function, yet these two fields have largely been studied independently from each other. The investigation into the neural basis of spatial navigation was propelled forward over 40 years ago by the discovery of \textit{place cells} in ambulating rats \citep{OKeeDost71}. Place cells are neurons, primarily located in the hippocampus, that fire action potentials whenever the animal is physically located at a particular spot in world. They are remarkable in that they reveal a clear mapping of the external environment onto a neural substrate, and they provided the first indication as to how the brain might create an internal, or cognitive, map of our surroundings. This finding, which has since earned discoverer John O'Keefe a nobel prize (CITE), spawned an entire subfield of neuroscience focused on the detailing the neural representation of space in the rodent hippocampus and the surrounding medial temporal lobe structures of the brain.

In contrast, our understanding of the neural underpinnings of memory function is rooted in human neurophysiology. When patient H.M.\ had his hippocampi removed to treat his medication-resistant epilepsy, he could no longer reliably form new memories \citep{ScovMiln57}. More specifically, he could no longer form new \textit{episodic} memories, or memories for experienced events \citep{Tulv72}. As with rodents and  place cells, this discovery of a clear functional relationship between a neural structure -- once again, the hippocampus -- and an observable behavior served to focus much of the field's future attention. In this case, it was focused on the role of the human hippocampus in supporting episodic memory function.

In spite of this historical delineation, the space we inhabit and the memories we form within those spaces are intricately linked. When we reimagine the past, be it what we had for breakfast today or a favorite childhood birthday party from decades prior, the location of the past event is one of the primary and salient features of the memory. A main goal of the work described in this dissertation is to bridge the divide between these areas of research, spatial navigation in rodents and memory for past events in humans, and simultaneously study spatial navigation and memory function using human neural recordings. In order to do so, I will first describe certain methodological details upon which my work is based, including how the neural data is collected and how human navigation and memory can be probed in an experimental setting.

\section{Human intracranial recordings}

Rodent place cells were discovered by recording \textit{in vivo} activity from individual neurons using electrodes inserted into rodent hippocampus. To facilitate making comparisons to rodent research, the studies performed here all make use of the rare opportunity to collect intracranial recordings of neural activity from electrodes implanted directly in the human brain. For clear ethical reasons, recording neural activity from the general population using direct brain implants is not justifiable. As a result, this work relies on data from the population of epilepsy patients who are undergoing monitoring for seizure localization. These patients all suffer from seizures that cannot be controlled though pharmacological intervention, and they have elected to have electrodes placed subdurally (on the surface of the cortex) as well as to have electrode depth probes inserted into deeper brain structures, such as the hippocampus.

The goal of this procedure is to localize the area of the brain responsible for the generation of seizures, with the aim of ultimately ressecting the seizure focus to reduce or eliminate seizure production. Patients remain in the hospital for $\sim$1--3 weeks while their brain activity is being recorded. The data collected using this method, known as either intracranial electroencephaologic (iEEG) or electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, provide the clinicians with a means of assessing which areas of the brain are epileptogenic, and the procedure results in significant reduction in seizure frequency in approximately 50\% of patients \citep{Kaha06}. 

When patients are not occupied with clinical matters, they are often free to participate in cognitive studies, affording researchers a unique opportunity to measure the electrical activity of the brain recorded via direct contact with active tissue. The data collected with this methodology can be broken down into two distinct categories. First, one can analyze the signals recorded from macroelectrodes, which are relatively large contacts with diameters measured in the range of millimeters. These contacts record the activity of a $\sim$4mm$^{2}$ area of tissue, encompassing the summed activity of many \hl{number} of neurons. Signals recorded from these macroelectrodes are generally analyzed by either examining how voltage changes as a function of experiment condition, or by decomposing the voltage time series into its constituent frequencies and determining how the power (amplitude squared) and phase of the signal at various frequencies is related to experimental conditions of interest.

The second type of data is collected from microelectrodes, which are much smaller than macroelectrodes, having diameters in the range of microns (in the case of the studies performed here, the microelectrodes have a diameter of 40$\mu$m). Microelectrodes extend from the tip of the depth probes inserted into deep brain structures, and, importantly, are small enough to measure the action potentials of individual neurons. Here, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the voltage or power signal, but is rather the timing and rate of neuronal spiking. This spiking data is analogous to the type of data that led to the discovery of place cells in rodents, allowing for similar analytic methods to be carried out on human data.

% As a result, non-invasive techniques to study the relationship between brain activation and cognition such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dominate the field of cognitive neuroscience. However, while fMRI has proved to be an invaluable, and due to to its accessibility, very popular,  neuroscience tool, its utility is limited 

\section{The neural representation of space}

% The work described in this dissertations, in particular in Chapters 2 and 3,

When place cells were discovered and their properties first studied in the 1970s, researchers had their first glimpse into the precise neural mechanisms supporting an organism's ability to self-localize within the external environment. Place cells, with their well-defined ``place fields'' that link a physical location to an internal representation \citep{OKeeNade78}, suggested a simple and concrete mechanism by which the brain creates a map of the world. With a large enough set of place cells, each one coding for a particular region of space, an animal's location at any given moment can be represented by the activity of the population of cells. Indeed, if enough simultaneous place cells are recorded, a rodent's position can be accurately reconstructed from the neural activity \citep{WilsMcNa93,ZhanEtal98}. For a time, it seemed as though a pure cognitive map, as hypothesized by Edward Tolman decades prior \citep{Tolm48}, had been found.

Over time, however, it has become clear the spatial representation system in the brain is much more complex. Not only are there place cells in the hippocampus that code for particular locations, but there are numerous other types of cells throughout the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that are tuned to specific environmental properties. For example, head direction cells in pre- and parasubiculum code for the direction the animal is facing \citep{TaubEtal90}, border or boundary cells in the entorhinal cortex (EC) code for locations near the edge of an environment \citep{SolsEtal08}, and grid cells in the EC have non-localized firing fields that tessellate across an entire region of space \citep{HaftEtal05}.

In addition to these specialized cell types, brain oscillations -- the result of the summed activity of populations of neurons \citep{LachEtal03} -- are closely tied to rodent spatial navigation. Of particular interest is the hippocampal \textit{theta} oscillation, typically defined as 4--10 Hz, whose amplitude increases during periods of voluntary movement \citep{Vand69}. Moreover, theta is mechanistically related to the activity of spatially tuned cells. The theta oscillation is thought to play a key role in coordinating the timing of action potentials of place cells, such that the likelihood of firing varies as function of the phase of theta \citep{OKeeRecc93,SkagEtal96}. Oscillatory interference models of EC grid cell generation causally rely on theta when explaining how grid cells are formed \citep{BurgEtal07}. The diversity of spatially tuned cells and their modulation by oscillatory activity raises questions about how all of this information is integrated and what roles different MTL structures may play in supporting navigation abilities.

In contrast to the large volume of work describing the neural representation of space in the rodent brain, there has been relatively little work investigating the same questions in humans. Place cells and grid cells have indeed been shown to exist in human MTL \citep{EkstEtal03,JacoEtal10,JacoEtal13}, and low frequency oscillations are more prominent during periods of movement \cite{CaplEtal03,KahaEtal99}. However, our knowledge of how the human brain represents external space still pales in comparison to our knowledge of rodents. Do the properties of spatially tuned cells vary based on brain region? Does the theta oscillation, with its strong functional ties to navigation in the rodent, act in an analogous manner in humans? Furthermore, with so much of the MTL seemingly dedicated to spatial processing, reconciling how the same part of the brain is vital for memory function in humans has been a challenge. An aim of my work is to investigate these issues with the same level of detail as they have been investigated in rodents.

\section{Overview}

In chapter 2, I take what (limited) knowledge of what we know about the human neural representation of space and show how it fits into models of memory function.

In chapter 3, I extend our knowledge of the human neural representation of space, which further links rodent and human literature and gives us insight into the precise roles of MTL regions. New cell type is a key advancement of the field.

In chapter 4, I more precisely compare core findings from rodent navigation with human data fom a optimized task. some similarities, but some differences with important theoretical implications.
